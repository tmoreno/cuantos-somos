Every time there is a demonstration, a concert, a sport event or a crowded gathering of people, we receive uneven figures comparing the figures we receive from the promoters and the ones from the police or any other governmental body.

If you are tired of this uneven information and want to know the real number of persons who attend an event, this is your app!

Use "How Many Are We?" in the next demonstration you take part in, in your local festivals, or when celebrating the latest victory of your team. 

With "How Many Are We?" everyone shares their position and the number of persons who are with them in the same place instantly appears in real time.

Once you have shared your position, just refresh your screen to watch how the number of persons who are with you is increasing.

You also can tweet the number of persons you are to make more people join you.

You don't need to register in any web page, all what you need is a Twitter profile.
